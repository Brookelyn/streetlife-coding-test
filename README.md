Streetlife front-end coding test

###Comments

I was somewhat unsure, from the spec provided, whether I was meant to link the full comment feed provided with the newsfeed - especially as part of the requirement was to only provide the latest two comments. I therefore created a separate comment feed in order to show how a longer list of comments would look.

I assumed that the comments_count property in the array translated to the total number of comments.
